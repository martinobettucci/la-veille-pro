Create a model response
post
 
https://api.openai.com/v1/responses
Creates a model response. Provide text or image inputs to generate text or JSON outputs. Have the model call your own custom code or use built-in tools like web search or file search to use your own data as input for the model's response.

Request body
input
string or array

Required
Text, image, or file inputs to the model, used to generate a response.

Learn more:

Text inputs and outputs
Image inputs
File inputs
Conversation state
Function calling

Show possible types
model
string

Required
Model ID used to generate the response, like gpt-4o or o3. OpenAI offers a wide range of models with different capabilities, performance characteristics, and price points. Refer to the model guide to browse and compare available models.

include
array or null

Optional
Specify additional output data to include in the model response. Currently supported values are:

file_search_call.results: Include the search results of the file search tool call.
message.input_image.image_url: Include image urls from the input message.
computer_call_output.output.image_url: Include image urls from the computer call output.
reasoning.encrypted_content: Includes an encrypted version of reasoning tokens in reasoning item outputs. This enables reasoning items to be used in multi-turn conversations when using the Responses API statelessly (like when the store parameter is set to false, or when an organization is enrolled in the zero data retention program).
instructions
string or null

Optional
Inserts a system (or developer) message as the first item in the model's context.

When using along with previous_response_id, the instructions from a previous response will not be carried over to the next response. This makes it simple to swap out system (or developer) messages in new responses.

max_output_tokens
integer or null

Optional
An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a response, including visible output tokens and reasoning tokens.

metadata
map

Optional
Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with a maximum length of 512 characters.

parallel_tool_calls
boolean or null

Optional
Defaults to true
Whether to allow the model to run tool calls in parallel.

previous_response_id
string or null

Optional
The unique ID of the previous response to the model. Use this to create multi-turn conversations. Learn more about conversation state.

reasoning
object or null

Optional
o-series models only

Configuration options for reasoning models.


Show properties
service_tier
string or null

Optional
Defaults to auto
Specifies the latency tier to use for processing the request. This parameter is relevant for customers subscribed to the scale tier service:

If set to 'auto', and the Project is Scale tier enabled, the system will utilize scale tier credits until they are exhausted.
If set to 'auto', and the Project is not Scale tier enabled, the request will be processed using the default service tier with a lower uptime SLA and no latency guarentee.
If set to 'default', the request will be processed using the default service tier with a lower uptime SLA and no latency guarentee.
If set to 'flex', the request will be processed with the Flex Processing service tier. Learn more.
When not set, the default behavior is 'auto'.
When this parameter is set, the response body will include the service_tier utilized.

store
boolean or null

Optional
Defaults to true
Whether to store the generated model response for later retrieval via API.

stream
boolean or null

Optional
Defaults to false
If set to true, the model response data will be streamed to the client as it is generated using server-sent events. See the Streaming section below for more information.

temperature
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or top_p but not both.

text
object

Optional
Configuration options for a text response from the model. Can be plain text or structured JSON data. Learn more:

Text inputs and outputs
Structured Outputs

Show properties
tool_choice
string or object

Optional
How the model should select which tool (or tools) to use when generating a response. See the tools parameter to see how to specify which tools the model can call.


Hide possible types
Tool choice mode
string
Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model.

none means the model will not call any tool and instead generates a message.

auto means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools.

required means the model must call one or more tools.

Hosted tool
object
Indicates that the model should use a built-in tool to generate a response. Learn more about built-in tools.


Hide properties
type
string

Required
The type of hosted tool the model should to use. Learn more about built-in tools.

Allowed values are:

file_search
web_search_preview
computer_use_preview
Function tool
object
Use this option to force the model to call a specific function.


Hide properties
name
string

Required
The name of the function to call.

type
string

Required
For function calling, the type is always function.

tools
array

Optional
An array of tools the model may call while generating a response. You can specify which tool to use by setting the tool_choice parameter.

The two categories of tools you can provide the model are:

Built-in tools: Tools that are provided by OpenAI that extend the model's capabilities, like web search or file search. Learn more about built-in tools.
Function calls (custom tools): Functions that are defined by you, enabling the model to call your own code. Learn more about function calling.

Show possible types
top_p
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

truncation
string or null

Optional
Defaults to disabled
The truncation strategy to use for the model response.

auto: If the context of this response and previous ones exceeds the model's context window size, the model will truncate the response to fit the context window by dropping input items in the middle of the conversation.
disabled (default): If a model response will exceed the context window size for a model, the request will fail with a 400 error.
user
string

Optional
A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. Learn more.

Returns
Returns a Response object.

Structured Outputs vs JSON mode
Structured Outputs is the evolution of JSON mode. While both ensure valid JSON is produced, only Structured Outputs ensure schema adherance. Both Structured Outputs and JSON mode are supported in the Responses API,Chat Completions API, Assistants API, Fine-tuning API and Batch API.

We recommend always using Structured Outputs instead of JSON mode when possible.

However, Structured Outputs with response_format: {type: "json_schema", ...} is only supported with the gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18, and gpt-4o-2024-08-06 model snapshots and later.

Structured Outputs	JSON Mode
Outputs valid JSON	Yes	Yes
Adheres to schema	Yes (see supported schemas)	No
Compatible models	gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o-2024-08-06, and later	gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4-* and gpt-4o-* models
Enabling	text: { format: { type: "json_schema", "strict": true, "schema": ... } }	text: { format: { type: "json_object" } }

Structured data extraction
You can define structured fields to extract from unstructured input data, such as research papers.

Extracting data from research papers using Structured Outputs
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { zodTextFormat } from "openai/helpers/zod";
import { z } from "zod";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const ResearchPaperExtraction = z.object({
  title: z.string(),
  authors: z.array(z.string()),
  abstract: z.string(),
  keywords: z.array(z.string()),
});

const response = await openai.responses.parse({
  model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  input: [
    {
      role: "system",
      content:
        "You are an expert at structured data extraction. You will be given unstructured text from a research paper and should convert it into the given structure.",
    },
    { role: "user", content: "..." },
  ],
  text: {
    format: zodTextFormat(ResearchPaperExtraction, "research_paper_extraction"),
  },
});

const research_paper = response.output_parsed;

}
How to use Structured Outputs with text.format
Step 1: Define your schema
First you must design the JSON Schema that the model should be constrained to follow. See the examples at the top of this guide for reference.

While Structured Outputs supports much of JSON Schema, some features are unavailable either for performance or technical reasons. See here for more details.

Tips for your JSON Schema
To maximize the quality of model generations, we recommend the following:

Name keys clearly and intuitively
Create clear titles and descriptions for important keys in your structure
Create and use evals to determine the structure that works best for your use case
Step 2: Supply your schema in the API call
To use Structured Outputs, simply specify

text: { format: { type: "json_schema", "strict": true, "schema": ‚Ä¶ } }
For example:

const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    input: [
        { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step." },
        { role: "user", content: "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23" }
    ],
    text: {
        format: {
            type: "json_schema",
            name: "math_response",
            schema: {
                type: "object",
                properties: {
                    steps: {
                        type: "array",
                        items: {
                            type: "object",
                            properties: {
                                explanation: { type: "string" },
                                output: { type: "string" }
                            },
                            required: ["explanation", "output"],
                            additionalProperties: false
                        }
                    },
                    final_answer: { type: "string" }
                },
                required: ["steps", "final_answer"],
                additionalProperties: false
            },
            strict: true
        }
    }
});

console.log(response.output_text);
Note: the first request you make with any schema will have additional latency as our API processes the schema, but subsequent requests with the same schema will not have additional latency.

Step 3: Handle edge cases
In some cases, the model might not generate a valid response that matches the provided JSON schema.

This can happen in the case of a refusal, if the model refuses to answer for safety reasons, or if for example you reach a max tokens limit and the response is incomplete.

try {
  const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    input: [{
        role: "system",
        content: "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step.",
      },
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23"
      },
    ],
    max_output_tokens: 50,
    text: {
      format: {
        type: "json_schema",
        name: "math_response",
        schema: {
          type: "object",
          properties: {
            steps: {
              type: "array",
              items: {
                type: "object",
                properties: {
                  explanation: {
                    type: "string"
                  },
                  output: {
                    type: "string"
                  },
                },
                required: ["explanation", "output"],
                additionalProperties: false,
              },
            },
            final_answer: {
              type: "string"
            },
          },
          required: ["steps", "final_answer"],
          additionalProperties: false,
        },
        strict: true,
      },
    }
  });

  if (response.status === "incomplete" && response.incomplete_details.reason === "max_output_tokens") {
    // Handle the case where the model did not return a complete response
    throw new Error("Incomplete response");
  }

  const math_response = response.output[0].content[0];

  if (math_response.type === "refusal") {
    // handle refusal
    console.log(math_response.refusal);
  } else if (math_response.type === "output_text") {
    console.log(math_response.text);
  } else {
    throw new Error("No response content");
  }
} catch (e) {
  // Handle edge cases
  console.error(e);
}

Refusals with Structured Outputs
When using Structured Outputs with user-generated input, OpenAI models may occasionally refuse to fulfill the request for safety reasons. Since a refusal does not necessarily follow the schema you have supplied in response_format, the API response will include a new field called refusal to indicate that the model refused to fulfill the request.

When the refusal property appears in your output object, you might present the refusal in your UI, or include conditional logic in code that consumes the response to handle the case of a refused request.

const Step = z.object({
  explanation: z.string(),
  output: z.string(),
});

const MathReasoning = z.object({
  steps: z.array(Step),
  final_answer: z.string(),
});

const completion = await openai.beta.chat.completions.parse({
  model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  messages: [
    { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step." },
    { role: "user", content: "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23" },
  ],
  response_format: zodResponseFormat(MathReasoning, "math_reasoning"),
});

const math_reasoning = completion.choices[0].message

// If the model refuses to respond, you will get a refusal message
if (math_reasoning.refusal) {
  console.log(math_reasoning.refusal);
} else {
  console.log(math_reasoning.parsed);
}

The API response from a refusal will look something like this:
